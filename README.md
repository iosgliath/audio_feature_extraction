# audio_feature_extraction


This file impletements audio feature extraction techniques while using the less external packages possible.

Using
    WAV.jl for reading .wav file
    FFTW.jl for Discrete Cosine transform ( mydct() is working in progress)

How to use :

    λsr, ϕl, powspec, bin, fbankDB, fmfcc, ∇fmfcc, ∇∇fmfcc = generateFeatures(file, preemph = 0.97, ϕl = 0.025, ∇ϕ = 0.01, nfilt=20, num_ceps = 12)
    myplot!(file, powspec, fbankDB, fmfcc, bin, λsr, ϕl, start=1, finish=0, colors="warm")

    λsr = sample rate
    ϕl = window length ( converted to power of 2 for Cooley Tuckey FFT implementation)

   fmfcc = Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient of size ( num_ceps, nframes)
   ∇fmfcc = Delta Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient of size ( num_ceps, nframes)
   ∇∇fmfcc = Delta Delta Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient of size ( num_ceps, nframes)
    
  #   generateFeatures() will return our features
   takes several paremeters as input:
       file -> .wav // 
       premph -> pre emphasis filtering coefficient (first filtering of signal) // 
       ϕl -> window length in secs // 
       ∇ϕ -> hopsize in secs // 
       nfilt -> number of filters for generating mel scale // 
       num_ceps -> number of MFCCs to keep for each frame // 



 #   myplot!() will return a mosaic of plots
   filename followed by frequency of maximal power spectral demnsity for the first frame of the batch
   4 bins of the power spectrum (frames 1, 10, 20 and 30)
   a heatmap of the filter banks
   a heatmap of the MFCCs



  #  General process :
   input signal 
        -> premph filt 
        -> framing 
        -> window transform 
        -> discrete fourrier transform 
        -> log 
        -> discrete cosine transform

   For now, only Hamming window is implemented.
